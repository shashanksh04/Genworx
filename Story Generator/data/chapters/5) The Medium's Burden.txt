Alright, I need to write a chapter titled "The Medium's Burden" that focuses on Samantha Davis's experience in the mansion. Let me start by setting the scene. The chapter should open with Samantha entering the mansion, highlighting the eerie atmosphere and her internal conflict as a medium. I should describe the mansion's decaying state—cracked walls, cobwebs, the scent of decay—to emphasize the oppressive mood.  

Next, I need to show Samantha's unease as she senses the presence of trapped souls. Maybe she touches the mirror and experiences a vision, like the spirit of a young girl trapped in the mansion. This vision should be vivid, with sensory details—cold air, the girl’s whisper, the mirror’s reflection distorting. I need to convey her terror and the Mirror’s influence on her, making it clear that the entity is trying to overwhelm her.  

Then, I should build tension by having the visions escalate. Perhaps the girl’s spirit becomes more aggressive, pulling Samantha into a darker memory—like Victor Holloway’s rituals, the screams of the cursed. This ties into the broader plot by linking the Mirror to Victor’s past and the cult’s influence. Samantha’s struggle here should highlight her vulnerability, showing that even a skilled medium isn’t immune to the Mirror’s power.  

I need to include the entity’s voice—cold, mocking, taunting her about her limitations. This dialogue should reveal the Mirror’s true nature as a prison and its intent to consume her. The climax of the chapter would be Samantha’s desperate attempt to escape, with the Mirror’s influence intensifying, leaving her trapped in a vision of endless darkness.  

Finally, wrap up with Samantha breaking free, though traumatized, and the lingering question of whether the Mirror has claimed her. This sets up her role in the larger story and hints at the entity’s ongoing threat. I need to make sure the chapter is around 3000 words, with detailed descriptions and a tense, atmospheric flow that aligns with the horror genre.
